# Mission Statement
---
We are creating an API for an animal adoption website hub.
We would like various shelters to post available animals that are ready to be adopted and give potential animal owners an easy way to access this information.

# Testing Directions
**NOTE**
This is scaffolding for utilizing the Web Api. You might still need to change certain values based on your own databases made from this program

1. Clone Solution
2. Upon opening solution find the **Postman Tests** folder in the file location for the solution
3. Included is the AnimalShelter.postman_collection.json file
4. In Postman import a new Workspace
5. Drag and drop AnimalShelter.postman_collection.json
6. In the workspace you will notice a plethora of endpoints
7. Use *Post* Register Vet Account - This will create your account as a Vet
8. Use *Get* Vet Token - This will automatically pull in your Bearer Token into the other tests 
9. The Vet Account was made for the Vaccine Tests. Initial testing of Vaccine will not enable any other tests
10. Use *Post* Logout - This will enable you to create a new user
11. Use *Post* Register Company Account - This will create your account as a Company
12. Use *Get* Company Token - This will automatically pull in your Bearer Token into the other tests 
13. The Company Account was specifically made for the Post class and it's controllers
14. Use *Post* Dog, Cat, and Bunny to allow you to test the Animals class. The Animals class will enable the Post class Tests
15. Test the Post Class *Post*, *Get*, *Put*, and *Delete* Animal Posts endpoints
16. Use *Post* Logout
17. Use *Post* Register Customer Account - This will create your account as a Customer
18. Use *Get* Customer Token - This will automatically pull in your Bearer Token into the other tests 
19. The Customer Account was made for the Adopt Tests. Previous testing of the Company process will enable the Adoption Tests
20. This is the time to Test Comments and Replies. Comments on Posts will enable the Replies Tests.
21. Adoptions can now be successfully tests
